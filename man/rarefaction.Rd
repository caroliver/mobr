\title{Rarefied Species Richness}
\usage{
rarefaction(x, method, effort = NULL, coords = NULL, latlong = NULL,
  dens_ratio = 1, extrapolate = FALSE, return_NA = FALSE,
  quiet_mode = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{can either be a: 1) mob_in object, 2) community matrix-like
object in which rows represent plots and columns represent species, or 3)
a vector which contains the abundance of each species.}

\item{method}{either 'indiv', 'samp', or 'spat' for individual, sample, or
sample spatially explicit based rarefaction respectively. To compute the
sample-based, non-spatial rarefaction curve specify 'indiv' method with the
appropriate \code{dens_ratio} (see Details).}

\item{effort}{optional argument to specify what number of individuals or 
number of samples depending on 'method' to compute rarefied richness as. If
not specified all possible values from 1 to the maximum sampling effort are
used}

\item{coords}{an optional matrix of geographic coordinates of the samples.
Only required when using the spatial rarefaction method and this information
is not already supplied by \code{x}. The first column should specify 
the x-coordinate (e.g., longitude) and the second coordinate should 
specify the y-coordinate (e.g., latitude)}

\item{latlong}{boolean, defaults to FALSE. Whether the coordinates are
latitude-longitudes or not. If TRUE, distance calculations by downstream
functions are based upon great circle distances rather than Euclidean
distances. Note latitude-longitudes should be in decimal degree.}

\item{dens_ratio}{the ratio of individual density between a reference group
and the community data (i.e., x) under consideration. This argument is
used to rescale the rarefaction curve when estimating the effect of
individual density on group differences in richness.}

\item{extrapolate}{boolean which specifies if richness should be extrapolated
when effort is larger than the number of individuals using the chao1 method.
Defaults to FALSE in which case it returns observed richness. Extrapolation
is only implemented for individual-based rarefaction 
(i.e., \code{method = 'indiv'})}

\item{return_NA}{boolean defaults to FALSE in which the function returns the
observed S when \code{effort} is larger than the number of individuals or
number of samples (depending on the method of rarefaction). If set to TRUE
then NA is returned. Note that this argument is only relevant when
\code{extrapolate = FALSE}.}

\item{quiet_mode}{boolean defaults to FALSE, if TRUE then warnings and other
non-error messages are suppressed.}
}
\value{
A vector of rarefied species richness values
}
\description{
The expected number of species given a particular number of individuals or
samples under and assumption of random sampling with replacement.
}
\details{
The analytical formulas of Cayuela et al. (2015) are used to compute
  the random sampling expectation for the individual and sampled based
  rarefaction methods. The spatially constrained rarefaction curve (Chiarucci
  et al. 2009) also known as the sample-based accumulation curve (Gotelli and
  Colwell 2001) is computed by sampling each plot in the order of their
  spatial proximity. If plots have the same distance from the focal plot then
  one is chosen randomly to be sampled first. Each plot in the dataset is
  treated as a starting point and then the mean of these n possible
  accumulation curves is computed.

For individual-based rarefaction if effort is greater than the number of
individuals and \code{extrapolate = TRUE} then the Chao1 method is used 
(Chao 1984, 1987). The code used to perform the extrapolation was ported
from \code{iNext::D0.hat} found at \url{https://github.com/JohnsonHsieh/iNEXT}. 
T. C. Hsieh, K. H. Ma and Anne Chao are the original authors of the
\code{iNEXT} package. 

If effort is greater than sample size and \code{extrapolate = FALSE} then the 
observed number of species is returned.

\examples{
data(inv_comm)
data(inv_plot_attr)
sad = colSums(inv_comm)
inv_mob_in= make_mob_in(inv_comm, inv_plot_attr)
# rarefaction can be performed on different data inputs
# all three give same answer
# 1) the raw community site-by-species matrix
rarefaction(inv_comm, method='indiv', effort=1:10)
# 2) the SAD of the community
rarefaction(inv_comm, method='indiv', effort=1:10)
# 3) a mob_in class object
# rescaling of individual based rarefaction 
# when the density ratio is 1 the richness values are 
# identical to unscale rarefaction
rarefaction(inv_comm, method='indiv', effort=1:10, dens_ratio=1)
# however the curve is either shrunk when density is higher than 
# the reference value (i.e., dens_ratio < 1)
rarefaction(inv_comm, method='indiv', effort=1:10, dens_ratio=0.5)
# the curve is stretched when density is lower than the 
# reference value (i.e., dens_ratio > 1)
rarefaction(inv_comm, method='indiv', effort=1:10, dens_ratio=1.5)
# sample based rarefaction under random sampling
rarefaction(inv_comm, method='samp')
# sampled based rarefaction under spatially explicit nearest neighbor sampling
rarefaction(inv_comm, method='spat', coords=inv_plot_attr[ , c('x','y')],
            latlong=FALSE)
# the syntax is simplier if suppling a mob_in object
rarefaction(inv_mob_in, method='spat')
